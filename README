ABOUT

    SubRenamer allows you to set a correspondence between multiple
    video and subtitle filenames so as to allow automatic subtitle
    loading in video players or multimedia hard drives


USING
    
    SubRenamer is programmed in Python, therefore no building is
    needed.

    It does, however, require the following dependencies to run:
      - Python 2.6
      - wxPython

    To launch the application run:
    $ python main.py
    In the application's root directory
